# DGS_Übersezter
This is a program that can take input from either a user's webcam or a video file and translate sign language fingerspelling to text output on the screen. It will be trained initially for the German Sign Language alphabet or Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DGS), but may consist of more languages in the future.
